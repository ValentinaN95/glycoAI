## üí° Example Conversations

**"What's my average glucose level?"**
> Based on your 14-day data, your average glucose is 142 mg/dL with good stability. Your time in range is 68%, which is close to the clinical target of >70%. üìä

**"I keep having morning highs. What can I do?"**
> I notice you have dawn phenomenon with glucose rising 30-40 mg/dL between 4-7 AM. This affects 5 out of 14 mornings in your data. Consider discussing overnight insulin adjustments with your healthcare provider. üåÖ

**"How does my weekend compare to weekdays?"**
> Interesting pattern! Your weekends show 15 mg/dL lower average glucose (135 vs 150 mg/dL weekdays). You seem to have more consistent meal timing on weekends. üìà

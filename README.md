- **Comprehensive Insights**: Time-in-range analysis, pattern detection, and personalized recommendations
- **HIPAA-Aware**: Designed with healthcare data privacy in mind

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

- `glucobuddy_functions.py` - Core API integrations and data analysis
- `main.py` - Gradio interface and application logic
- `config.py` - Configuration management and API keys
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dexcom Developer Account (for production use)
- Anthropic API Key (for AI insights)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the application files**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   ```

4. **Set up Dexcom API credentials** (optional for demo):
   - Register at [Dexcom Developer Portal](https://developer.dexcom.com)
   - Create a new application
   - Add your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to .env

5. **Set up Claude API** (optional for enhanced insights):
   - Get API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:7860`
